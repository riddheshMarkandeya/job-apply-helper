This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can add fields that are then copyable by just one click. Also you can add job post url at the bottom which increases counter. 
It resets everyday so you can try to get your daily goal. Everything is saved locally as json inside the `json/` folder.
